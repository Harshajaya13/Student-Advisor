                <h2>Trap #1: The "Senior" Echo Chamber</h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest mistake? blindly asking a senior "Which language is best?" and following it without asking "Why?" 
                </p>
                <p>
                    They suggest what worked for <em>them</em>, or what was trending <em>last year</em>. You pick it up, you hate it, and you quit halfway through. <strong>Their path is not your blueprint.</strong>

                <h2>Trap #2: The Infinite Ocean</h2>
                <p>
                    Imagine you are on a boat crossing an ocean. Halfway there, you notice the seats aren't comfortable.

                    <strong>Would you jump into the sea just to swim to another boat?</strong>

                <p>
                    No. You would drown. Yet, students do this every day. They learn Python for 2 weeks, get bored, jump to Java, get stuck, jump to Web Dev. 
                    <strong>You never reach the shore if you keep changing boats.</strong> Pick one vessel and sail it to the end.

                <p>
                    Lack of clarity leads to "trying everything." You spend your first year dabbling. By the time you realize what you actually enjoy, your time is up.

                    <strong>The Danger:</strong> Graduating with a "basic knowledge" of 5 things, but mastery of zero. The market doesn't pay for "basics."

                    <h3>💰 The "Fear Economy"</h3>
                    <p>
                        Third-party institutes and course sellers invest in your <strong>Fear</strong>. They make you feel inadequate so you buy their ₹10,000 course. 
                        <strong>Say No.</strong> If you have the will, the internet has the resources for free. Confidence is free; don't pay for it.

                    <p>
                        Stop worrying about "Saturation." If you are truly capable—if you master your craft so deeply that you can solve problems others can't—you <strong>bend the market</strong> to you. 
                        No one can replace a master. Be the master.
